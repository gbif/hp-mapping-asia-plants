MAP operates in **six sub-regions** including Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Northeast Asia etc. Currently, each sub-region has built species databases. At Asia scale, vascular plants species database at genus level. Based on MAP’s investigation, several articles on the progress of plant research in these areas were published in Global Ecology and Conservation. These articles state the history, status and existing problems of vascular plant biodiversity research in Asia countries, and also list out the latest important resources. They provide important information for those who are interested in vascular plant diversity research in these regions and lay an important foundation for the establishment of a database of vascular plant diversity in Asia based on more accurate and up-to-date data.
